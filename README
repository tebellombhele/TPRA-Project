## Third-Party Risk Assessment (TPRA) Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Third-Party Risk Assessment (TPRA) Project** is designed to evaluate and mitigate security, compliance, and operational risks posed by external vendors. It provides a structured framework, automated assessment tools, and risk reporting mechanisms to help organizations manage vendor risks efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Vendor Risk Checklist** – Standardized evaluation questions for consistency.
- ⚙️ **Automated Risk Scoring** – Python-based scoring of vendor responses.
- 🔐 **Compliance Frameworks Support** – Aligned with NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA.
- 📊 **Risk Dashboard** – Jupyter Notebook for interactive risk visualization.
- 🛠️ **Configurable Parameters** – YAML-driven risk calculation logic.
