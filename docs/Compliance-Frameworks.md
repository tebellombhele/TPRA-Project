## üîç SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)

### Description
SOC 2 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage data to protect client interests and privacy. It focuses on five "Trust Service Criteria."

### Trust Service Criteria
1. **Security**
   - Protection against unauthorized access
   - Logical and physical access controls
   - System monitoring

2. **Availability**
   - System uptime and performance
   - Monitoring and incident response
   - Change management

3. **Processing Integrity**
   - Accurate, complete, and timely processing
   - Data validation and error handling
   - System monitoring for processing failures

4. **Confidentiality**
   - Protection of confidential information
   - Data classification and handling
   - Access controls for sensitive data

5. **Privacy**
   - Collection, use, retention, and disposal of personal information
   - Privacy notice and consent management
   - Data subject rights

### SOC 2 Report Types
- **Type I**: Tests design effectiveness at a specific point in time
- **Type II**: Tests design and operating effectiveness over a period (typically 6-12 months)

### Vendor Assessment Questions
- Does the vendor have a current SOC 2 Type II report?
- Which Trust Service Criteria are covered in the report?
- Are there any exceptions or management responses?
- How recent is the report (within the last 12 months)?
- Can the vendor provide the SOC 2 report under NDA?
